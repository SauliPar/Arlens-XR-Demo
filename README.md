XR Tracking Demo

This short tech demo is to showcase multiple image tracking feature using Android / iOS camera. In order for the feature to work, at least one of the images need to show up somewhere through the camera. The two images are provided in ./Assets/Art/ folder.

This demo gave me basic understanding on how to track images using mobile phone's camera and to view a gameobject in mixed reality. 

The Demo builds can be found under /Builds folder. There are both iOS and Android builds although the iOS version couldn't be tested due to lack of hardware.
